There are 4 ways of writing a function in JavaScript:

Function Declaration
Function Expression
Arrow Function
Annonomus Function

1. Function Declaration: Function Declaration is the traditional way to define a function. It is somehow similar to the way we define a function in other programming languages. We start declaring using the keyword “function”. Then we write the function name and then parameters.
2. Function Expression: Function Expression is another way to define a function in JavaScript. Here we define a function using a variable and store the returned value in that variable.
3. Arrow Functions: Arrow functions are been introduced in the ES6 version of JavaScript. It is used to shorten the code. Here we do not use the “function” keyword and use the arrow symbol.
4. Annonomus Function: Annonomus Function is another way to define a function in JavaScript without any name assigned to it.
