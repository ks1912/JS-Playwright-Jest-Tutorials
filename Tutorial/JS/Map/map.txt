The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element.

map() Syntax
The syntax of the map() method is:
arr.map(callback(currentValue), thisArg)

map() Parameters
The map() method takes in:

callback - The function called for every array element. Its return values are added to the new array. It takes in:
currentValue - The current element being passed from the array.
thisArg (optional) - Value to use as this when executing callback. By default, it is undefined.

map() Return Value
Returns a new array with elements as the return values from the callback function for each element.

map() does not change the original array.
map() executes callback once for each array element in order.
map() does not execute callback for array elements without values.
