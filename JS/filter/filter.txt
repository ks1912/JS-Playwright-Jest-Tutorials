The filter() method returns a new array with all elements that pass the test defined by the given function.

The syntax of the filter() method is:
arr.filter(callback(element), thisArg)

The filter() method takes in:
1.    callback - The test function to execute on each array element; returns true if element passes the test, else false. It takes in:
2.    element - The current element being passed from the array.
3.    thisArg (optional) - The value to use as this when executing callback. By default, it is undefined.

Notes:
1.  filter() does not change the original array.
2.  filter() does not execute callback for array elements without values.
