JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation

Example: '{"name":"John", "age":30, "car":null}'

If you parse the JSON string with a JavaScript program, you can access the data as an object:
let personName = obj.name; //John
let personAge = obj.age; //30

JavaScript has a built in function for converting JSON strings into JavaScript objects:
JSON.parse()

JavaScript also has a built in function for converting an object into a JSON string:
JSON.stringify()

The JSON.parse() function is used to convert a string into a JavaScript object while the JSON.stringify() function is used to convert a 
JavaScript object into a string. The JSON string is used whenever we want to transfer data from one program to another, within the program, 
it is better to use the JavaScript object rather than using the string operations. 
JavaScript provides these two functions as built-in functions, and these functions are supported by all modern-day browsers.

------------------------------

JSON data is written as name/value pairs (aka key/value pairs).
In JSON, values must be one of the following data types:
1.    a string
2.    a number
3.    an object
4.    an array
5.    a boolean
6.    null

In JavaScript values can be all of the above, plus any other valid JavaScript expression, including:
1.    a function
2.    a date
3.    undefined
